WebSocket API
WebSocket is a new Protocol of HTML5. It achieved full-duplex data transmission between the client and the server, allowing data to transmit effectively in both directions. Through only one simple handshake, the connection between the client and the server is established, and the server can push information to the client according to the business rules.
